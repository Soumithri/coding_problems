"""A cycle occurs when a node’s next points back to a previous node
in the list. The linked list is no longer linear with a beginning
and end—instead, it cycles through a loop of nodes.

Write a function contains_cycle() that takes the first node
in a singly-linked list and returns a boolean indicating
 whether the list contains a cycle.

NOTE: Do not change the function name. If you wish to change,
please modify unit tests accordingly
