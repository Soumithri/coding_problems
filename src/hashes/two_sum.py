# PROBLEM
""" Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers
such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

NOTE: Do not change the function name. If you wish to change,
please modify unit tests accordingly
