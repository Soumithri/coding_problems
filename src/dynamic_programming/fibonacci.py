"""
Write a function fib() that takes an integer nn and returns the
nth Fibonacci â†´ number.

Let's say our Fibonacci series is 0-indexed and starts with 0. So:

fib(0)  # => 0
fib(1)  # => 1
fib(2)  # => 1
fib(3)  # => 2
fib(4)  # => 3
...

NOTE: Do not change the function name. If you wish to change,
please modify unit tests accordingly
